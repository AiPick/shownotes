# W3M Web Browser - Enable Quicker Navigation Options
w3m  is  a  text based browser which can display local or remote web pages as well as other documents. It is able to process HTML tables
and frames but it ignores JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets. w3m can also serve as a pager for text  files  named  as  arguments  or
passed on standard input, and as a general purpose directory browser.

w3m  organizes its content in buffers or tabs, allowing easy navigation between them. With the w3m-img extension installed, w3m can dis‐
play inline graphics in web pages. And whenever w3m's HTML rendering capabilities do not meet your needs, the target URL can  be  handed
over to a graphical browser with a single command.
